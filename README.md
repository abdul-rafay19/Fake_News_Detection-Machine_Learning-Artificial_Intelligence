# üöÄ Fake News Detection

In today‚Äôs digital era, **fake news** has become a growing concern, leading to widespread misinformation and societal consequences. This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to accurately detect fake news articles, ensuring better dissemination of authentic information.

## üåü Features

- **Dataset Loading and Cleaning**: Efficiently loads datasets (`Fake.csv` and `True.csv`), removes null values, and cleans text for analysis.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Prepares raw text using techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements advanced classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses key performance metrics for evaluation:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly application built with **Streamlit**, providing real-time predictions.
- **Deployment**: Fully hosted and accessible online using **Streamlit**.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: Datasets sourced from reliable repositories (e.g., Kaggle or public datasets).
- **Format**: CSV files with the following structure:
  - `Fake.csv`: Labeled fake news articles.
  - `True.csv`: Labeled authentic news articles.

### üìÅ Key Dataset Details:
| **Attribute** | **Description**            |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| `Title`       | Headline of the news       |
| `Text`        | Full news content          |
| `Label`       | Classification (Fake/True) |
